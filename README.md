In recent times, the field of cybersecurity has seen a surge in the use of memory-resident malware. Cyberattacks designed to evade defense mechanisms are on the rise, with the use of memory-resident malware increasing by an astounding 1400%. This indicates that the technologies threatening cybersecurity are becoming more sophisticated. Such malware hides its activities and traces while residing in RAM, making memory forensics essential for analyzing affected systems from a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) perspective.

Conducting memory forensics requires both collection and analysis tools. Notable analysis tools include Rekall and Volatility. However, development and support for Rekall have already been discontinued. Volatility has both version 2 and version 3. Version 2 has been widely used for malware detection and analysis due to its useful features and efficiency, but development and support for it have ceased with the transition to version 3. During this transition, several digital forensic investigators and Volatility users have noted that some features effective for malware detection and analysis were omitted. This is one of the major issues that undermines the precision and efficiency of the memory forensic process. Furthermore, forensic investigators may find it overwhelming to sift through large amounts of data during memory forensics to investigate malicious processes. In most cases, analysts do not initially know which processes are malicious, making the analysis process twice as challenging.

To address these issues and perform memory forensics more quickly and efficiently, we introduce WiMA (Windows Memory Analyzer).
